# angular2-multi-component-dynamic-form

A small playground using Angular2 RC1 which demonstrates a way to structure an application with a large dynamic form. There is routing so a form can be in multiple steps but the central form object in form of a service is persisted through the app. There are validations (default and custom) + additional customizations that might be needed.
